How to handle the ANT files to get results:

1. Main HTML file is ant, a web page.
2. Sibling folder (at same level as .html) is "draw-stuff" and "ant".
  (You can move this folder elsewhere if you change ant.html accordingly.)
3. Web page links to (loads) cssant/styles.css
4. Web page has some HTML markup for title, header and text.
5. After body, web page loads two script files one called "draw-stuff" another "ant" with fcns.
6. After that, another Script section defines another function.
7. And then runs some "loose" Javascript commands.

How to show (and run) the web page:
8. Drag and drop the html file onto a browser to see what it does.

(*) Key: use fcn key F12 to open a "javascript console" in your browser
and see what might be going wrong: errors and warnings.

Problems: 
	unknown if any problems exist yet
	***project description says to make square grid of 41x41 we believed this to be an error/typo and made it 410x410 instead
complexity: 
	O(N) describes our algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of number of steps.
